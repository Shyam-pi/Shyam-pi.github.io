**Note:** This project was done in collaboration with <a href='https://github.com/vedran97'>Vedant Ranade</a> and <a href='https://github.com/SakshamV'>Saksham Verma</a> who were majorly responsible for the hardware setup and tuning, while I was involved predominantly with the perception stack.

TerpBot is a unique unicycle mobile robot developed from the ground up, boasting a simple yet effective design. With wheel odometry and a raspicam based monocular depth estimation module for perception, it navigates its surroundings with precision.

**Capabilities:**

The TerpBot has the following capabilities :

- RRT* Smart based global path planning + Potential Fields based local path planning : <a href='https://shyam-pi.github.io/projects/rrt_star/'>Link</a>
- YOLO based detecting and following a human leader + monocular depth estimation based dynamic obstacle avoidance : <a href='https://shyam-pi.github.io/projects/leader_follower/'>Link</a>


**Hardware System:**

Running on a Raspberry Pi 4B, TerpBot showcases the power of DIY robotics, offering a cost-effective and versatile solution for autonomous mobility. Its hardware system consists of the following parts :

**Kinematics:**
- TerpBot adopts a distinctive unicycle model built upon the principles of a differential drive system. 
- This design choice allows for enhanced maneuverability and agility in navigating diverse terrains. 
- By leveraging differential drive, TerpBot can adjust the speed and direction of its single wheel independently, enabling precise control and efficient movement. 
- This approach not only simplifies the mechanical structure but also maximizes flexibility, making TerpBot well-suited for a variety of tasks and environments.

**Controls and Controller Design:**
- We have utilized an Anti-Windup PID controller for controlling wheel velocities of the Terpbot.  The Arduino Uno microcontroller has been programmed in a very optimal way, to achieve a near perfect trajectory tracking result. The Arduino Uno had the following tasks: 
- Accurately count time (us resolution)
- Accurately count ticks coming from each encoder. 
- Calculate ticks read in a unit time. (Ticks read in a unit time, is like velocity calculation)
- Communicate this tick rate to the Raspberry PI without loss of synchronization.
- Receive Control Targets of each motorâ€™s tick rate, in a jitter free manner.
- Execute the control loop under the control sampling frequency, leaving enough time for other tasks to run.
