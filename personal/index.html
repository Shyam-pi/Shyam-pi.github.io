And speaking of ice cream, let’s just say it’s my ultimate happy pill!</p> <p>But you know what really tickled my fancy? Taking a nighttime jaunt through the enchantingly lit streets of Washington D.C. with my pals. Vintage vibes and twinkling lights – it felt like stepping into a dream!</p> <p>Life’s all about those little moments that bring a smile to your face, isn’t it?

My dance journey started casually, attempting to mimic popping moves from dance TV shows with friends. My body randomly grooving to some music playing in my brain has been quite a common occurence over the years.</p> <p>Though I lack formal training, I bravely attempted to join competitive dance teams twice. The first time, nerves turned me into a stiff statue (cue brain popping instead of my body 🤯). The second time, I had to learn a one minute choreo as a part of the induction process, and I realized that I was amidst seasoned pros, who picked it up within 5 minutes. Then there was poor me, still figuring where my left leg should go at the 31st second of the choreo, after 30 minutes of practicing.</p> <p>Despite the comical mishaps, I love dancing and the way it makes me feel. I have had a quirky relationship with it as well. Way too shy to dance in front of friends, but absolutely fearless on a stage in front of a crowd. Understanding myself in these moments?

I always looked up to her and wanted to be good at art just like her (key note - ‘wanted to be’ 😮‍💨). I loved pencil sketches while I was still in middle school, and would always draw some fighter plane (inspired from some film), fish (from my own aquarium) or ship (inspired from Pirates of the Carribean) on my notebooks. But over the years, as life took its course, this interest of mine sort of died down.</p> <p>Fast forward, I’m surrounded by close friends who are passionate about and are very skilled at art. I did my first artwork in almost 10 years (and first ever painting, I think), because these blessed souls decided to organize a ‘Paint Nite’ with me. The theme was ‘Halloween’ and I decided to paint a cat (I’m surrounded by cat enthusiasts, and the influence has kinda rubbed off) sitting on a Halloween pumpkin with the help of an image from the internet. Absolutely 10/10 tranquil and immersive experience, thoroughly loved it, and definitely something I’d love to put in some time as a hobby in the future.</p> </div> <hr> <div class="profile float-left"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/aquarium_1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/aquarium_1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/aquarium_1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/aquarium_1.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 rounded" width="auto" height="auto" alt="aquarium_1.jpg" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <div class="more-info"> <p>"After all this time?", "Always."</p> </div> </div> <div class="clearfix"> <p><strong>AQUARIUMS</strong></p> <p>Hey don’t get me wrong, I am a huge fan of dogs and cats (at least the less scary ones) and would stop to pet them any day, but fish in aquariums have always held a very special place in my heart and still do.

I discovered the adrenaline rush of competitive FPS gaming and even clinched victories in city-level tournaments in Valorant and Apex Legends. I still try to sneak in some play time whenever I’m free, which is more of a rarity nowadays.

It’s more than just entertainment – it’s a medium that allows us to experience a range of emotions, from exhilaration to contemplation.
