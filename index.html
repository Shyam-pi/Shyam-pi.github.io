My current research focus is on improving the generation and alignment capabilities of large language models. Currently I am pursuing my Robotics masters from the <a href="https://eng.umd.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">James Clark SChool of Engineering</a> at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park. I’m also working on 3D Computer Vision problems (involving NeRF and 3D GANS) with <a href="https://jbhuang0604.github.io/#group" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Jia-Bin Huang</a> at his Vision and Learning lab in UMD.</p> <p>Before I joined UMD, I worked for 8 months with <a href="https://www.shishirny.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya</a> as a Robotics Research Intern at the <a href="https://cps.iisc.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore</a> on autonomous driving research (obstacle avoidance and lower level control). During the same period, I also worked with <a href="https://mahabalaganaka.iiitb.ac.in/people/prasanna.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. G.N. Srinivasa Prasanna</a> on Computer Vision systems for farm robots, especially for crop health monitoring. I completed my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani), India. In my Bachelor’s thesis, I worked on predicting future paths of pedestrians in crowded environments to augment motion planning for autonomous vehicles.</p> </body></html>
