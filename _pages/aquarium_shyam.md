**AQUARIUMS**

<!-- Got introduced to world of gaming as a very young kid by my elder brother who appointed me as his professional kicker in the game of roadrash (if you know you know), and as his fellow comrade in Contra. It has ever since stuck with me mostly as a form of socializing with my friends, brother or cousins, or as a me time activity.

However, my interest in gaming peaked during 2019-2021, when I discovered competitive gaming and became a competitive FPS gamer winning city level tournaments in Valorant. Apex Legends happens to be my favorite game still, and I play it during whatever spare time I get. Life surely would never get as free as the times of lockdown (The only reason for me to miss 2020-2021)  -->

Hey don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of dogs and cats (at least the less scary ones) and would stop to pet them any day, but fish in aquariums have always held a very special place in my heart and still do. One of my fondest childhood memories is rushing home from school every day just to sit by our fish tank and watch those adorable little fish swim around for hours on end.

This fascination has stuck with me well into adulthood as you'll often find me completely entranced by aquariums or pausing at every water body that I come across and spending a solid minute or two looking for fish swimming around.
