**LIFE**

So, this picture was clicked on my 25th birthday, and I was supposed to be having a quarter-life crisis, but guess what? Great food and awesome company (AND HANDMADE ICE CREAM) got me grinning from ear to ear and feeling like I'm on cloud nine!

Let's talk about the good stuff – FOOD! With every delicious bite (Oh Thai food, I owe it all to you), my worries melt away faster than ice cream on a hot summer day. And speaking of ice cream, let's just say it's my ultimate happy pill!

But you know what really tickled my fancy? Taking a nighttime jaunt through the enchantingly lit streets of Washington D.C. with my pals. Vintage vibes and twinkling lights – it felt like stepping into a dream!

Life's all about those little moments that bring a smile to your face, isn't it? So, here's to relishing the happiness in every scoop of ice cream and every cozy night stroll. Cheers to hitting 25 and fully embracing life's incredible adventures!
