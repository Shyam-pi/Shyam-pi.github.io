**BADMINTON**

<!-- That's me, in my element, flying up in the air for a good ol' badminton smash, which happens to be a regular occurence every other evening (bless my knees and shins). Any form of sports keeps me up in high spirits (Hey, 'A sound mind in a sound body', after all), and badminton happens to be my top priority when it comes to sports in my life now.

I am a doubles player for the <a href='https://umdclubbadminton.weebly.com/team.html'>UMCP's collegiate badminton team</a>. Still on a draught for medals though, but hey, in my defense, it's only been 4 years since I started playing (hard coping, I know ðŸ˜”) -->

That's me, in my element, soaring through the air for a good ol' badminton smash, a regular occurrence every other evening (bless my knees and shins). Any form of sports keeps my spirits high, and Badminton happens to be at the top of my sports life right now. After all, 'A sound mind in a sound body,' right?

I am a doubles player for the <a href='https://umdclubbadminton.weebly.com/team.html'>UMCP collegiate badminton team (2023 - 2024)</a>. Still on a drought for medals, though. But hey, in my defense, it's only been 4 years since I started playing the sport, and I have only played one proper tournament (hard coping, I know ðŸ˜”)
