**GAMING**

<!-- Got introduced to world of gaming as a very young kid by my elder brother who appointed me as his professional kicker in the game of roadrash (if you know you know), and as his fellow comrade in Contra. It has ever since stuck with me mostly as a form of socializing with my friends, brother or cousins, or as a me time activity.

However, my interest in gaming peaked during 2019-2021, when I discovered competitive gaming and became a competitive FPS gamer winning city level tournaments in Valorant. Apex Legends happens to be my favorite game still, and I play it during whatever spare time I get. Life surely would never get as free as the times of lockdown (The only reason for me to miss 2020-2021)  -->

I was first introduced to the world of gaming as a young kid by my elder brother, who enlisted me as his trusty sidekick in games like Road Rash (a classic, if you know, you know) and Contra. Gaming quickly became a cherished pastime for me, serving as a way to socialize with my brother and friends,or simply as a form of relaxation during 'me time.'

However, my interest in gaming reached new heights during 2019-2021 when I delved into competitive gaming. I discovered the adrenaline rush of competitive FPS gaming and even clinched victories in city-level tournaments in Valorant and Apex Legends. I still try to sneak in some play time whenever I'm free, which is more of a rarity nowadays. Ah, the lockdown days â€“ the abundance of free time is the only thing I miss about it.
