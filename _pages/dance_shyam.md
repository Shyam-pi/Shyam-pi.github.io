**DANCE**

That's a very short part of a video of my last ever dance performance as an Undergrad. My dance journey started casually, attempting to mimic popping moves from dance TV shows with friends. My body randomly grooving to some music playing in my brain has been quite a common occurence over the years.

Though I lack formal training, I bravely attempted to join competitive dance teams twice. The first time, nerves turned me into a stiff statue (cue brain popping instead of my body ðŸ¤¯). The second time, I had to learn a one minute choreo as a part of the induction process, and I realized that I was amidst seasoned pros, who picked it up within 5 minutes. Then there was poor me, still figuring where my left leg should go at the 31st second of the choreo, after 30 minutes of practicing.

Despite the comical mishaps, I love dancing and the way it makes me feel. I have had a quirky relationship with it as well. Way too shy to dance in front of friends, but absolutely fearless on a stage in front of a crowd. Understanding myself in these moments? Well, let's just say it's a work in progress.
