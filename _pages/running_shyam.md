**TRACK & FIELD**

<!-- If someone tried to take at jab at me by saying that I look like I'm running towards some hot momos at the end of the race's finishing line, I probably would have agreed. I wasn't a photogenic track and field athlete at all, especially when I was hard focused on the race, CLEARLY. 

I was a sprinter and long jumper for <a href='https://www.instagram.com/bitspilani_athletics/'>BITS Pilani's Track & Field team</a> during 2016-2020. I made my way up from almost fainting after completing just one 400 meter warm-up lap in 2016 to being one of my college's fastest sprinters in 2020, which I am indeed a little proud about. It definitely is that one sport which instilled the need for discipline in me, and lessons from which I carry with me till date. Over the course of 4 years, I won several medals in 100m, 200m, 400m, 4x100m, 4x400m and long jump events across different inter-collegiate meets. -->

If someone tries to take a jab at me by saying that I look like I'm sprinting towards some hot momos at the end of the race's finishing line in the photo, I probably would agree. I wasn't the most photogenic track and field athlete, clearly, especially when I was intensely focused on my events.

I served as a sprinter and long jumper for <a href='https://www.instagram.com/bitspilani_athletics/'>BITS Pilani's Track & Field team</a> during 2016-2020. I made my way up from nearly fainting after completing just one 400-meter warm-up lap in 2016 to becoming one of my college's fastest sprinters by 2020, a fact I'm a little proud of. Sprinting truly instilled discipline in me, and its lessons are ones I carry with me to this day.

Over the course of four years, I earned several medals in events including the 100m, 200m, 400m, 4x100m, 4x400m relays, and long jump across various inter-collegiate meets. And interestingly, this photo is from the last ever track & field event I competed in.
