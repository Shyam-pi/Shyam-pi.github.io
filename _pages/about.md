Welcome! I'm an AI Engineer intern at [Renesas North America Ltd.](https://www.renesas.com/us/en) working on developing lightweight ML models for Renesas Edge Devices, and on creating an in-house python software for automatic ML deployment on user data. My current research focus is on improving the generation and alignment capabilities of large language models. Currently I am pursuing my Robotics masters from the [James Clark SChool of Engineering](https://eng.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, starting from Fall 2022. I'm also working on 3D Computer Vision problems (involving NeRF and 3D GANs) with [Dr. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/#group) at his Vision and Learning lab in UMD.

Prior to my masters, I worked with [Dr. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) as a Robotics Research Intern at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) on autonomous driving research (obstacle avoidance and lower level control). During the same period, I also worked with [Dr. G.N. Srinivasa Prasanna](https://mahabalaganaka.iiitb.ac.in/people/prasanna.html) as a Computer Vision intern working on Vision systems for farm robots, especially for crop health monitoring. I completed my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) (BITS Pilani), India. As a part of my Bachelor's thesis, I worked on estimating future paths of pedestrians in crowded environments using a computer vision detection, tracking and prediction pipeline to augment motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

If not for solving some challenging Mathematical/Programming problem or geeking over the latest tech, you can find me playing badminton, running, watching a thought-evoking film, playing some video game or taking a nature walk.
