Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an AI Engineer intern at [Renesas North America ltd.](https://www.renesas.com/us/en) working on developing lightweight ML models for Renesas Edge Devices. My current research focus is on improving the generation and alignment capabilities of large language models. Currently I am pursuing my Robotics masters from the [James Clark SChool of Engineering](https://eng.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park. I'm also working on 3D Computer Vision problems (involving NeRF and 3D GANS) with [Dr. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/#group) at his Vision and Learning lab in UMD.

<!-- Before I joined CMU, I worked in Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore, India where I was working in the Voice Intelligence Team on dialogue systems and chat-bots. Before that, I spent a wonderful semester working with Partha Talukdar at Machine and Language Learning (MALL) Lab in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I graduated with a B.Eng. in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India. In my Bachelor's thesis, I worked on incorporating external knowledge in distantly supervised neural relation extraction methods as part of iNELL (which is based on NELL). -->

Before I joined UMD, I worked for 8 months with [Dr. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) as a Robotics Research Intern at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) on autonomous driving research (obstacle avoidance and lower level control). During the same period, I also worked with [Dr. G.N. Srinivasa Prasanna](https://mahabalaganaka.iiitb.ac.in/people/prasanna.html) on Computer Vision systems for farm robots, especially for crop health monitoring. I completed my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani), India. In my Bachelor's thesis, I worked on predicting future paths of pedestrians in crowded environments to augment motion planning for autonomous vehicles.
