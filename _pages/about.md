Your description is quite detailed and informative! Here's a slightly revised version for clarity and flow, with some minor grammatical adjustments:

Welcome! I am an AI Engineer intern at [Renesas North America Ltd.](https://www.renesas.com/us/en), where I focus on developing lightweight ML models for Renesas Edge Devices and creating an in-house Python software for automatic ML deployment on user data. My current research centers around 3D Computer Vision applications, particularly in 3D Scene Reconstruction and Single/Multi-view Images to 3D problems. I am currently pursuing my Robotics master's degree from the [James Clark School of Engineering](https://eng.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, starting from Fall 2022. Additionally, I am involved in 3D Vision projects involving NeRF and 3D GANs with [Dr. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/#group) at his Vision and Learning lab at the University of Maryland, College Park.

Before beginning my master's program, I worked as a Robotics Research Intern under [Dr. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), focusing on autonomous driving research, specifically in obstacle avoidance and lower-level control. During the same period, I collaborated with [Dr. G.N. Srinivasa Prasanna](https://mahabalaganaka.iiitb.ac.in/people/prasanna.html) as a Computer Vision intern, working on Vision systems for farm robots, particularly in crop health monitoring. I completed my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/). For my Bachelor's thesis, I developed a system for estimating future paths of pedestrians in crowded environments using a computer vision detection, tracking, and prediction pipeline to augment motion planning for autonomous vehicles. This experience was instrumental in shaping my interest in Robotics and Computer Vision.

When I'm not tackling challenging Mathematical or Programming problems, you can find me playing badminton, going for a run, watching thought-provoking films, playing video games, or enjoying a nature walk.
