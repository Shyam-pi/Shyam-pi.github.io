Welcome! I am currently an AI Engineer intern at [Renesas North America Ltd.](https://www.renesas.com/us/en), where I focus on developing lightweight ML models for Renesas Edge Devices and crafting an in-house Python software for automatic ML deployment on user data. My research focus lies in the realm of 3D Computer Vision applications, particularly in 3D Scene Reconstruction and Single/Multi-view Images to 3D problems. I am also pursuing my Robotics master's degree from the [James Clark School of Engineering](https://eng.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, starting from Fall 2022. At UMD, I am involved in 3D Vision projects involving NeRF and 3D GANs, collaborating with [Dr. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/#group) at his Vision and Learning lab at the University of Maryland, College Park.

Prior to my master's program, I worked as a Robotics Research Intern under [Dr. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/), focusing on autonomous driving research, specifically in obstacle avoidance and lower-level control. Simultaneously, I collaborated with [Dr. G.N. Srinivasa Prasanna](https://mahabalaganaka.iiitb.ac.in/people/prasanna.html) as a Computer Vision intern, working on Vision systems for farm robots, particularly in crop health monitoring. I earned my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), where I developed a system for estimating future paths of pedestrians in crowded environments for my Bachelor's thesis. This project used a computer vision detection, tracking, and prediction pipeline to augment motion planning for autonomous vehicles. This experience was instrumental in shaping my interest in Robotics and Computer Vision moving forward in life.

When I'm not immersed in challenging Mathematical or Programming problems, you can find me playing badminton, going for a run, watching thought-provoking films, playing video games, or enjoying a nature walk. Oh and you can just call me 'Shyam', quite apt for how 'Shy' I 'Am' (Yep, got a pun with my name).
