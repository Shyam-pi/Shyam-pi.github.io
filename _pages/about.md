Welcome! I recently completed my year-long internship as an AI / ML Engineer at [Renesas Electronics America Ltd.](https://www.renesas.com/us/en), where I focused on developing lightweight ML models for Renesas Edge Devices and crafting an in-house Python software for automatic ML deployment on user data. I completed my Robotics masters program from the [James Clark School of Engineering](https://eng.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, in May 2024. At UMD, I worked on 3D Vision projects involving 3D GANs & GAN inversion for facial animation genAI in Spring 2023, in collaboration with [Dr. Jia-Bin Huang](https://jbhuang0604.github.io/#group) at his Vision and Learning lab.

Prior to my master's program, I worked as a Robotics Research Intern under [Dr. Shishir N.Y. Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/) at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, IISc Bangalore](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) in 2022, focusing on autonomous driving research, specifically in obstacle avoidance and lower-level control. Before that, I collaborated with [Dr. G.N. Srinivasa Prasanna](https://mahabalaganaka.iiitb.ac.in/people/prasanna.html) as a Computer Vision intern in 2021, working on Vision systems for farm robots, particularly in crop health monitoring. I earned my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), where I developed a system for estimating future paths of pedestrians in crowded environments for my Bachelor's thesis. This project used a computer vision based detection, tracking, and prediction pipeline for pedestrians, in order to augment path planning for autonomous vehicles. This experience was instrumental in shaping my interest in Robotics and Computer Vision moving forward in life.

When I'm not immersed in challenging Mathematical or Programming problems, you can find me playing badminton, going for a run, watching thought-provoking films, playing video games, or enjoying a nature walk. Oh and you can just call me 'Shyam', quite apt for how 'Shy' I 'Am' (Yep, got a pun with my name).
